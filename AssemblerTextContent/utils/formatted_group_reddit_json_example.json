I never had a clue he actually hates me and my husband.. a lot. \n\nThis isn’t the first time I felt a little awkward tension between Brandon and I, but Alissa let me know that he did like me and I was over thinking it. This was about a month ago now. \n\nMy brother in law 28M Cole just called us to let me know about his weekend plans, asked to hang, the average conversation.. but then was like “oh man, I gotta tell you that Brandon really let it be known that he can’t stand you guys at dinner with everyone and he really thinks you are the most annoying people in the family”. Cole had also said that Brandon had mentioned that he was thankful that Cole and their dad were at least “normal” unlike the rest of “us” who annoy the living heck out of him. \nSo basically the rest of us are trash. \n\nI am highly offended by this. This is the most blindsided I’ve ever been by someone who is actively seeking something for free from me. I am not just a free lance photographer, I am a luxury wedding photographer in a large city.  This is my career and also someone who is going to be in my family? \n\nBrandon also had said some not no nice things about my husband while on this rant about us, and I’m having a hard time not making a phone call directly to the source to confront this. I will always defend my own, immediately but must say I’m conflicted in causing family conflicts right before two large weddings are about to happen soon. \n\nPart of me feels extremely guilty and sad for Alissa because I do like her, we’ve never been extremely sisterly or close but she’s always been sweet and it really hurts that she was basically right there while Brandon sits letting everyone know that he has such a problem with us just days before this engagement session. I really don’t think I could show up on Sunday and play pretend after hearing that I am SOO annoying and the worst to be around. \n\nWould I be the asshole for canceling this session while also letting her know that I would not have hurt feelings if they didn’t want me there at all as I am now uncomfortable to be around them?

I saw that many of you asked for an update.\n\n\\*My daughter: After the cake \"incident,\" I asked her questions about whether M/half brother had ever laid hands on her, played such \"pranks\" on her, or behaved inappropriately (we never know). She told me no, explaining that the fights with her half-brother are mainly him annoying her. I also inquired if anyone else from both sides had made her uncomfortable in any way, and again, she said no. Since my last post, she has been seeing her psychiatrist twice a week. The bullying apparently started about two months ago. I don't know if it is related (although I am sure it is), but it was also around that time that M had a miscarriage.\n\n\\*Me: To be honest, I feel like a terrible mom. I did not see the signs. I am trying to fix everything.\n\n\\*My ex-husband: GUESS WHO SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR AT 10 PM???? He called me last night, was outside, and said he wanted to talk. I let him in, and because I don't trust him (I really don't), I recorded the whole conversation (with his consent). He told me that since the party, he's been thinking about what to do and yesterday told M about my desire for more custody. From what he told me, she said that it was not such a bad idea because my daughter was not fitting into their family dynamic. They started to argue, and at one point, she just started cursing me and my daughter. Apparently, I am a sneaky B-word who is bitter about her affair with my ex-husband. She described my daughter as a spoiled, bratty princess who needs correction. And now, he has to choose between which woman he loves the most. This is where he had the *click!* He left the house, drove around, and then showed up at my place. He is going to stay at a friend's house to think about his relationship with M. Our daughter will stay with me during the week and visit him on the weekends. I told him that if he's going to get back together with M, I am continuing with full custody. But if they divorce,it will depends of his custody for his son because I don't want him around my daughter. He agreed.\n\nThat's it. Thank you for all the support.",

I'm not going to lie and say I had no weird feelings about it when we broke up, but I also didn't expect my mom to just fire her. My mom is extremely dependent on Maddie and to be honest probably thinks of her like a daughter.\n\nWhen I met my beautiful wife \"Lanie\" she had reservations and wasn't comfortable about Maddie still being in the picture, but I assured her she was simply my mom's assistant. Lanie still resents my mom for keeping Maddie around, but knows I am devoted to her.\n\nRecently we revealed to our families that we are expecting our first child. We just told our parents and weren't planning on telling anyone else. To be fair we didn't mention this to my mom and I guess she told Maddie who thought it was a big joke and told everyone.\n\nLanie was furious and I confronted my mom. My mom said she didn't realize it was a secret and she didn't think Maddie would tell so many people. She said she just mentioned it while Maddie was doing her hair for an event.\n\nNow Lanie was irate and so was I, so I told my mom she had gone too far and it is sick how she keeps Maddie in our lives. I said if she wants to see her grandchild she needs to fire Maddie so we can all move on. My mom told me I was being a child and she doesn't give in to people threatening her. Now everyone is saying I'm an asshole and idk. I would feel slightly bad if Maddie lost her job because I know she makes bank plus all the trips and gifts, like she isn't going to get another job like that, but my priority is Lanie's well being.

I&amp;#39;m not going to lie and say I had no weird feelings about it when we broke up, but I also didn&amp;#39;t expect my mom to just fire her. My mom is extremely dependent on Maddie and to be honest probably thinks of her like a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I met my beautiful wife &amp;quot;Lanie&amp;quot; she had reservations and wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable about Maddie still being in the picture, but I assured her she was simply my mom&amp;#39;s assistant. Lanie still resents my mom for keeping Maddie around, but knows I am devoted to her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently we revealed to our families that we are expecting our first child. We just told our parents and weren&amp;#39;t planning on telling anyone else. To be fair we didn&amp;#39;t mention this to my mom and I guess she told Maddie who thought it was a big joke and told everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lanie was furious and I confronted my mom. My mom said she didn&amp;#39;t realize it was a secret and she didn&amp;#39;t think Maddie would tell so many people. She said she just mentioned it while Maddie was doing her hair for an event.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now Lanie was irate and so was I, so I told my mom she had gone too far and it is sick how she keeps Maddie in our lives. I said if she wants to see her grandchild she needs to fire Maddie so we can all move on. My mom told me I was being a child and she doesn&amp;#39;t give in to people threatening her. Now everyone is saying I&amp;#39;m an asshole and idk. I would feel slightly bad if Maddie lost her job because I know she makes bank plus all the trips and gifts, like she isn&amp;#39;t going to get another job like that, but my priority is Lanie&amp;#39;s well being. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

She  divorced me for her co-worker., she was abusive and we fought all the time. Anyway,  when that relationship failed she started being nice to me. I have a 15 YR Son named Sean. We have a great relationship. His mother and I are starting to co parent better. Here is the issue, his mother can't stand the fact I am in a relationship and she is no longer seeing her co worker, she can't seem to keep a boyfriend right now. She's quite difficult to be with. She hates my girlfriend and therefor Sean and my girlfriend do not have a relationship as Sean does whatever his mother says. I've tried talking with Sean, he is somewhat like his mother. My GF will not force a relationship either. She says if someone doesn't want to be apart of her life then she don't need them. I have to agree as my son and ex wife has been unfair to her.\n\nNow, This past week, I've been out of town for work. I already informed my ex and my son that I wouldn't be around.  My girlfriend decided to take some time this week to do things she's wanted to do around the house, some repairs and decorating. My ex called me to tell me that she met someone and wanted to know if Sean can stay at my house while she spends the weekend with this guy. I told her that Sean is perfectly capable of staying home at their house by himself. She said that she doesn't  want him home alone and that he is scared incase something happens.  She insisted that she will drop him off at my house. I told her that my GF is not going to watch him, she is not obligated to watch someone who has treated her like shit for the entire time we have been together and that Sean can stay home at his house.  My GF has tried in the past to have a relationship with them both and they have refused so that ship has sailed unless my GF really wants to which, at this point,  I'd say no because we all know that they are just using her and I am not allowing that.  My ex wife says I am choosing my girlfriend over our son which I don't feel that I am. I feel that I am choosing to teach my son that listening to his mother and acting like her will cause him to face consequences down the road.  I even talked to my GF and she says she doesn't feel comfortable being at home with a 15 year old that practically hated her, and it just be them two, knowing how he and his mother can be.She said if things were different and they had a great relationship,  she wouldn't mind but not this way.  I support her and I don't want her to feel uncomfortable either. My Son comes over every other weekend and this isn't even our weekend either. So , you all tell me.",

Not necessarily frequency, but quality - I would describe her as very vanilla and I'm quite kinky. Like only one or 2 positions and it took her ages to get naked with me - doesn't like oral ,(conveniently accepts it though). But the relationship is great in a lot of ways so I've turned a blind eye.\n\nAsking her about it, she said she had a lot of partners before we got together and when COVID happened, she found herself on her own so she worked on herself and discovered herself. She never said how many guys she's been with but I assumed it's more than me. Which isn't hard as I've only been with less than 10 women in my life. She said before me, she hasn't had sex in about 2 years.\n\nWe've been getting serious lately and by chance I introduced her to my foster bro (31M). I've known him for over 20 years so I love him like a true sibling. Everything seemed ok in the meeting, but afterwards he messaged me asking to talk. He said he realised he knows where he knows her from. Basically, he said he realises she was this girl that was that notorious and who when he and his mates went out, she was a real slag. Basically, she was into everything and anything - threesomes, spit roasts, gang bangs - everything. She even did an amateur porno apparently. He protests he never fucked her, but knows loads of his mates who did. He said the rule of thumb if she was out, you knew you'd be lucky apparently.\n\nI couldn't get it out my mind so asked her about what he said. She basically admitted it, saying yep she was that person. She apologised for keeping it from me but said she was ashamed of it and that she isn't that person anymore.\n\nSince then, I feel really weird about her - I feel basically she's a hypocrite. She doesn't do certain acts or positions yet did in the past. She once had a go at me for watching porn yet did it herself in the past. In terms of her number, it seems like she's well in triple digits. \n\nI've been trying to process it, but a couple of days ago she tried to have sex and tried to do things she's never wanted to do, basically acted all slutty. I told her to stop and it feels weird and she got all defensive and said isn't it what I want - I don't know why, it just feels not.\n\nI can't explain it but I feel like something is broken between us. I love her, but I can't look at her the same way again.\n\nWIBTAH for breaking up with her over her past?",

She never said how many guys she&amp;#39;s been with but I assumed it&amp;#39;s more than me. Which isn&amp;#39;t hard as I&amp;#39;ve only been with less than 10 women in my life. She said before me, she hasn&amp;#39;t had sex in about 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been getting serious lately and by chance I introduced her to my foster bro (31M). I&amp;#39;ve known him for over 20 years so I love him like a true sibling. Everything seemed ok in the meeting, but afterwards he messaged me asking to talk. He said he realised he knows where he knows her from. Basically, he said he realises she was this girl that was that notorious and who when he and his mates went out, she was a real slag. Basically, she was into everything and anything - threesomes, spit roasts, gang bangs - everything. She even did an amateur porno apparently. He protests he never fucked her, but knows loads of his mates who did. He said the rule of thumb if she was out, you knew you&amp;#39;d be lucky apparently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t get it out my mind so asked her about what he said. She basically admitted it, saying yep she was that person. She apologised for keeping it from me but said she was ashamed of it and that she isn&amp;#39;t that person anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, I feel really weird about her - I feel basically she&amp;#39;s a hypocrite. She doesn&amp;#39;t do certain acts or positions yet did in the past. She once had a go at me for watching porn yet did it herself in the past. In terms of her number, it seems like she&amp;#39;s well in triple digits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to process it, but a couple of days ago she tried to have sex and tried to do things she&amp;#39;s never wanted to do, basically acted all slutty. I told her to stop and it feels weird and she got all defensive and said isn&amp;#39;t it what I want - I don&amp;#39;t know why, it just feels not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t explain it but I feel like something is broken between us. I love her, but I can&amp;#39;t look at her the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;WIBTAH for breaking up with her over her past?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In my culture, and 18th birthday is a big deal, so a huge party is to be expected. I told all of my friends who were coming in a groupchat that they could invite a plus one. What I didn’t know, was that my boyfriend, who was also in the groupchat, decided to also invite a plus one. I had no idea of this beforehand because I assumed that since he is my boyfriend I would be the one he would be with for my birthday. I dont know if thinking like that is selfish or not, but I only really put him in that groupchat so that he knows the important details of things.\n\nSo the time comes for my birthday and as all the guests are filing in my boyfriend walks in with this girl. They’re talking and laughing and having a good time, but basically the whole party his attention was with her. I have never met this girl, and I couldn’t help but feel extremely jealous since she was undeniably gorgeous. At the table I had at the front where my closest friends and I were supposed to sit for dinner, my boyfriend had the audacity to ask if his plus one could sit with us. He was talking with her the whole time, and I couldn’t help but feel extremely angry and jealous the whole time. Even my other girlfriends at the table were giving me looks about her. However, I said nothing at that time to keep the peace and I tried my hardest to not let such a deal ruin my night.\n\nAfterwards when everyone left, including my boyfriend’s plus one, I basically screamed at him asking why he would invite another girl to my 18th birthday. I get that I could have been in the wrong for raising my voice and being jealous and angry, but he basically told me that since I said everyone could bring a plus one he could too. He was telling me to chill out and that she’s just his friend from work. I can’t help but feel sick every time I think about them. I couldn’t help but notice how flirty and lost in his eyes he looked when he talks to her. Am I just overreacting about this or should I confront him again about his relationship with her?",

          "selftext": "I have been with my husband for 7 years and I gave birth to our baby 4 months ago. I also have a step daughter \"Anaya\", who is 13. Anaya and I get along for the most part but as she gets older, the typical entitled teenager attitude is getting fierce. However, 2 years back she started personally attacking people when she doesn't get her way and the disrespect is getting severe in these moments.\n\nLast week she asked me if I would bring her to a local \"concert\" this afternoon at 2pm. It's a small town and the band in question is 4 high schoolers in the area. They're actually really good. They often play at the local church and have done the school talent show a few times. But this was their first actual gig. I said I could and she had intended to meet up with her group of friends. Two nights ago however she started in with her list of demands. Like she expected me to just drop her off (not happening, as this is an open to the public event), or she expected me to get her there a couple hours early so she could hang out with her friends before the concert. I told her that wasn't happening either because I have the baby and getting her there early would cut in to the babies nap time. She was pissed but didn't say anything.\n\nWell, at 12:00 she started harping on me about when we were leaving. I told her that I would get her there a half hour early, which meant we still had over an hour (the concert is 10 minutes away). She starts harping on me to \"just bring her there now\" but I said no. She slams off to her room. She comes out about 10 minutes later, fully dressed and stood by the door with her arms crossed and a scowl on her face. I told her again that we weren't leaving right now and she ignored me. So, I decide to get myself something to eat because the baby was finally sleeping. I settled on crackers but they didn't taste right (my taste buds are still screwed up) and went to make myself a sandwich. Anaya instantly got even more pissed. She's like \"you can't just eat it in the car?\" I told her no. She then says \"it's not like you even need it anyways. You're just trying to make me mad at this point\". It's not the first time she's commented on my weight. So not only did her words sting but she managed to wake the baby. So I looked at her and said \"you're not going. Go to your room, now.\" She started in with the protests and I just pointed down the hall. She slams off to her room crying. Well, my husband just called and asked me why I'm not bringing Anaya to the concert after I said I would and I told him it was because she told me that I didn't even need the food (she was calling me fat) and woke up the baby so no, I'm done with the disrespect and I'm not bringing her. He's telling me the punishment doesnt match the crime and I basically said tough shit. If he wants her to go, he can come bring her but I'm not dealing with her after that. AITA?\n\nETA: dropping her off to be by herself of bringing her earlier than a half hour (as I specified multiple times) wouldn't be an option. Her dad has made it clear that she was not to be dropped off and without an adult because just 2 months ago she was dropped off early at a school dance and she left with her group of friends and got caught smoking pot. Her dad has made it clear she is not to be without parental supervision for the foreseeable future because of that incident. And again, I wasn't cutting in to the babies nap time to bring her 1-2 hours early to this concert, like she wanted me to. I was doing her a favor by even offering to bring her a half hour early. She was stomping her foot by the door and making comments an hour before the concert even opened it's doors (so an hour and 20 minutes before the concert started), which goes against the time line I agreed to. She was acting like this long before I even got pregnant. I'm sure some of the hostility has to do with the baby but certainly not all of it. ",

I also have a step daughter &amp;quot;Anaya&amp;quot;, who is 13. Anaya and I get along for the most part but as she gets older, the typical entitled teenager attitude is getting fierce. However, 2 years back she started personally attacking people when she doesn&amp;#39;t get her way and the disrespect is getting severe in these moments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last week she asked me if I would bring her to a local &amp;quot;concert&amp;quot; this afternoon at 2pm. It&amp;#39;s a small town and the band in question is 4 high schoolers in the area. They&amp;#39;re actually really good. They often play at the local church and have done the school talent show a few times. But this was their first actual gig. I said I could and she had intended to meet up with her group of friends. Two nights ago however she started in with her list of demands. Like she expected me to just drop her off (not happening, as this is an open to the public event), or she expected me to get her there a couple hours early so she could hang out with her friends before the concert. I told her that wasn&amp;#39;t happening either because I have the baby and getting her there early would cut in to the babies nap time. She was pissed but didn&amp;#39;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, at 12:00 she started harping on me about when we were leaving. I told her that I would get her there a half hour early, which meant we still had over an hour (the concert is 10 minutes away). She starts harping on me to &amp;quot;just bring her there now&amp;quot; but I said no. She slams off to her room. She comes out about 10 minutes later, fully dressed and stood by the door with her arms crossed and a scowl on her face. I told her again that we weren&amp;#39;t leaving right now and she ignored me. So, I decide to get myself something to eat because the baby was finally sleeping. I settled on crackers but they didn&amp;#39;t taste right (my taste buds are still screwed up) and went to make myself a sandwich. Anaya instantly got even more pissed. She&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t just eat it in the car?&amp;quot; I told her no. She then says &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s not like you even need it anyways. You&amp;#39;re just trying to make me mad at this point&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s not the first time she&amp;#39;s commented on my weight. So not only did her words sting but she managed to wake the baby. So I looked at her and said &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re not going. Go to your room, now.&amp;quot; She started in with the protests and I just pointed down the hall. She slams off to her room crying. Well, my husband just called and asked me why I&amp;#39;m not bringing Anaya to the concert after I said I would and I told him it was because she told me that I didn&amp;#39;t even need the food (she was calling me fat) and woke up the baby so no, I&amp;#39;m done with the disrespect and I&amp;#39;m not bringing her. He&amp;#39;s telling me the punishment doesnt match the crime and I basically said tough shit. If he wants her to go, he can come bring her but I&amp;#39;m not dealing with her after that. AITA?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ETA: dropping her off to be by herself of bringing her earlier than a half hour (as I specified multiple times) wouldn&amp;#39;t be an option. Her dad has made it clear that she was not to be dropped off and without an adult because just 2 months ago she was dropped off early at a school dance and she left with her group of friends and got caught smoking pot. Her dad has made it clear she is not to be without parental supervision for the foreseeable future because of that incident. And again, I wasn&amp;#39;t cutting in to the babies nap time to bring her 1-2 hours early to this concert, like she wanted me to. I was doing her a favor by even offering to bring her a half hour early. She was stomping her foot by the door and making comments an hour before the concert even opened it&amp;#39;s doors (so an hour and 20 minutes before the concert started), which goes against the time line I agreed to. She was acting like this long before I even got pregnant. I&amp;#39;m sure some of the hostility has to do with the baby but certainly not all of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I didn't graduate highschool but got a GED and started working as a welder and hunting guide. The rest of my family is pretty successful, for instance my father is a lawyer and my mom used to be an RN, brothers own companies, sister got married to a lawyer, etc. \n\nI'm glad my family found a lot of success, but they can be very shallow and often put me down for what I do for work. My mom will make comments like \"When are you going to school to get a real job?\" or stuff like that. They didn't want to pay for welding school so I worked at an auto shop to pay my own way through. They often go on vacations and cruises without me because I \"won't be able to appreciate the culture or food\" and other bs like that. I love them but I have been slowly pulling away from them over the last few years since I can tell that we live different lives and they have no interest in sharing their lives with me. \n\nNOW. My grandfather's brother \"Mike\" and I have always been pretty close. Mike and I used to go hunting when I was pretty young, and even though Mike was also working in law he and I shared a love of the outdoors and nature. About a year ago, Mike was diagnosed with cancer and has quickly gone down hill in the last few months. I have taken a lot of time off of work to care for him since he is my oldest relative and no one else wants to take care of a frail, sick old man for some callous reason. His wife died fifteen years ago and he doesn't have any children. \n\nHe recently asked me if taking care of him was hurting me financially, and I told him that I was cutting back on hours at work but I loved him more than any of my other family members so it was my pleasure to take care of him. The next time I went to visit him he revealed to me that he was having his will changed and would be willing his \"hunting cabin\" (it's not a cabin, its a small single-family home with power and running water, on 70+ acres) to me, along with about $100,000 to \"get it fixed up and start your life.\" He wants the rest of his estate to be liquified and donated to different causes that he was passionate about. \n\nMike is actively dying now. He asked to be taken out of hospice so he can die at home with his dog (who will also be coming with me when he passes away). In HIS OWN HOME my family was talking about how much money Mike has, and how when he dies they want to convert his hunting cabin into a summer vacation home and how they were going to fund a big \"memorial trip\" to Europe on his dime, since we are his last remaining family and they expect the majority of his wealth to be broken up between us all. They do not know that everything is being donated and I am getting the house and some of his money. \n\nI know that if/when they find out about what Mike has so graciously done for me, they will rip me down and curse his name. I don't want to be around for the fall out, I plan to set aside some money for renovating the house for full-time use and start a small welding company someday. **So, WIBTAH if I cut them out of my life as soon as Mike is gone?** Seeing this new greedy side of them has soured me a lot and I don't know if I can even stand being around them anymore, even though I know that Mike always said that your family should be everything to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: My great uncle is willing a large plot of land and a lot of money to me, greedy family wants to use it for a trip to Europe.** ",

I have taken a lot of time off of work to care for him since he is my oldest relative and no one else wants to take care of a frail, sick old man for some callous reason. His wife died fifteen years ago and he doesn&amp;#39;t have any children. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He recently asked me if taking care of him was hurting me financially, and I told him that I was cutting back on hours at work but I loved him more than any of my other family members so it was my pleasure to take care of him. The next time I went to visit him he revealed to me that he was having his will changed and would be willing his &amp;quot;hunting cabin&amp;quot; (it&amp;#39;s not a cabin, its a small single-family home with power and running water, on 70+ acres) to me, along with about $100,000 to &amp;quot;get it fixed up and start your life.&amp;quot; He wants the rest of his estate to be liquified and donated to different causes that he was passionate about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mike is actively dying now. He asked to be taken out of hospice so he can die at home with his dog (who will also be coming with me when he passes away). In HIS OWN HOME my family was talking about how much money Mike has, and how when he dies they want to convert his hunting cabin into a summer vacation home and how they were going to fund a big &amp;quot;memorial trip&amp;quot; to Europe on his dime, since we are his last remaining family and they expect the majority of his wealth to be broken up between us all. They do not know that everything is being donated and I am getting the house and some of his money. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that if/when they find out about what Mike has so graciously done for me, they will rip me down and curse his name. I don&amp;#39;t want to be around for the fall out, I plan to set aside some money for renovating the house for full-time use and start a small welding company someday. &lt;strong&gt;So, WIBTAH if I cut them out of my life as soon as Mike is gone?&lt;/strong&gt; Seeing this new greedy side of them has soured me a lot and I don&amp;#39;t know if I can even stand being around them anymore, even though I know that Mike always said that your family should be everything to you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: My great uncle is willing a large plot of land and a lot of money to me, greedy family wants to use it for a trip to Europe.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Most weren't bad or anything, and I'm sure they meant well! I'm just really sensitive, and my love languages veer hard towards touch and praise so I'm still working on having gifts like being sent to camp really hit right as affection.\n\n\nI was never homesick or anything, because I didn't have a home to be sick for. But it wasn't the best time. \n\n\nAnyway, two years ago, my parents got really into the idea of being parents. They took in and then adopted my sisters Merida (14F), having been in foster care, and Melisa (13F) who was orphaned at a young age and has been the ward of several members of our family. (She's fully adopted to us now, don't worry! I'll be sending her stupid puns until I die. Then I'll just haunt her and say them to her face.)\n\n\nI was brought back and told I wouldn't be returning to boarding school; they wanted me there to bond with my sisters and make sure they were completely cemented into our family. They were really happy about how exciting and sweet it would be to be a family all together. \n\n\nAnd it's been *amazing*. I admit, this is more like living with distant relatives who happen to be my parents than any great, world changing familial love I was hoping for - but it's still there.\n\n\nYesterday, they told me they want to send me to a eight week camp and then a boarding school. They said it was because the house just felt too crowded and they wanted time to focus on my sisters, and that anyway I was too spoiled and entitled and could make them feel less sure of themselves. I asked when, and they said that it wasn't anything I had *done*, exactly, I was just the eldest + a boy + their bio kid, so I could make them feel insecure by accident.\n\n\nI snapped that I felt pretty insecure too after not being raised by them and they don’t mollycoddle *me* about it, and they got really serious. They said that I knew nothing of loneliness, that my sisters had suffered horribly while I was becoming an entitled spoiled brat. \n\n\nThey're not wrong. While Melisa was repeatedly abandoned by our family and Merida was in foster care, I had a really easy life. I was never a ward of the state or sleeping on a stranger's couch or anything. I just don’t want to leave home again because it kinda feels like I’ll be leaving my family/being socially disowned. Which I know is irrational, especially since my sisters are way better at texting/talking on the phone than my parents, but it feels like they should at least try to comfort me for ten minutes. It feels like I’ll never come home again until I’m an adult, and by then I’ll have no real claim at all on their affection.\n\n\nAnyway, this whole mess dissolved like they always do. I objected, they started upping their threats, I pleaded and then threw a fit. Mature, I know. They just talked to me (I'm off school for a bad fever) and affirmed that I have no say in this. \n\n\nHere's where I absolutely screwed up: I said that my sisters aren't the only ones who've ever suffered, and I said that my parents only loved my sisters because it made them feel good about themselves. My sisters definitely heard that and I'm so scared I hurt them. They don't have any part in this.\n\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm the AH for questioning my parents' motives to their face.\n\n\n**TL;Dr:** I was told to go to camp and then boarding school, and promptly threw a tantrum, questioned my parents love for me and then their *motives* for loving my sisters. In the process I accidentally implied my parents don't actually love my sisters.",

We come from a deep poverty and I managed to get myself through school through schollarships and bursaries and now I am settled and building my carrer at a comfortable rate. Back to my sister, she stayed with me for a year and a half, in all this year, not look for a job, missed all university applications deadlines, gives me attaitude, stays up god knows where, checky to me and always \"fighting\"with my 6 year old son. This year, a week before the easter holidays I have made up my mind that I she needs to go back home. She has been nothing but a pain since staying with me, attitude, lazying around, couch potato, sleeping all day. A week before she had to move out she told me she is pregnat, 4 months. I take her to the doctor, and she is actually 7 and half month pregnant. Because of the feuds and fighting I have tried to avoid her as much as possible in my own house. I did not see the pregnancy. I am now even more LIVID than ever, and want her out of my house. Our family want me to think things over and give änother\"chance. AITAH for kicking out my 7 and a half baby sister out?",

Before she moved, I had enrolled her in a teching diploma back home, which she dropped out without my knowledge because &amp;quot;she did not like the course&amp;quot;. Her moving in with me was the family, myself and her agreeing to a cecond chance. (I stopped talked to her when I lwerned she dropped out.) We come from a deep poverty and I managed to get myself through school through schollarships and bursaries and now I am settled and building my carrer at a comfortable rate. Back to my sister, she stayed with me for a year and a half, in all this year, not look for a job, missed all university applications deadlines, gives me attaitude, stays up god knows where, checky to me and always &amp;quot;fighting&amp;quot;with my 6 year old son. This year, a week before the easter holidays I have made up my mind that I she needs to go back home. She has been nothing but a pain since staying with me, attitude, lazying around, couch potato, sleeping all day. A week before she had to move out she told me she is pregnat, 4 months. I take her to the doctor, and she is actually 7 and half month pregnant. Because of the feuds and fighting I have tried to avoid her as much as possible in my own house. I did not see the pregnancy. I am now even more LIVID than ever, and want her out of my house. Our family want me to think things over and give änother&amp;quot;chance. AITAH for kicking out my 7 and a half baby sister out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A close family member recently died, I received a phone call early in the morning basically telling me that the family member would not make it.  I called my wife in the early morning to inform her that I was going to the hospital to see them.  A bit of backstory we recently had a big storm and we notice that there was a stain from water leaking in the ceiling, couldn't identify if there were leaking pipes or what the root caused was so we called a plumber.  Ok... back to the issue, when I told my wife that I would be going to the hospital, she initially said ok, and I believe she said keep me posted.  \n\nOnce I started heading in the direction of the hospital roughly 1 minute she called me back, and asked how long would I be??  To which I replied I don't know, my family member is dying, to which she responded with well I need to know because we may have a plumber coming.  I was dumbfounded...I said a family member is dying, to which she replied, well when I told you my grandmother died you asked me if I wanted to have sex, (this was a joke albeit a bad, and poorly timed one on my part) but nonetheless I still said it.  I have a bad habit of saying the wrong things at the wrong time.....anyways.  I proceeded to get really mad, and said i don't need this s$#t, and hung up on her.\n\nMy family member died, and I was devasted, but because I was so mad, I didn't bother updating her.  I was so upset that she would even bother to bring up the ceiling at this terrible time.  I eventually left, and on the way home I called her to say I was coming home.  At no point did she ask what happened, nor did she text or call while ago was at the hospital. For context I called her at 6:15am they passed away at 6:45am, I unfortunately did not get there until rough 7ish.  I got home and was understandably upset, so my kids asked what was wrong and I told them that my family member passed away.  Mind you she (my wife) had not said a word to me since I got home.\n\nWe finally spoke today, and she unloaded on me that I didn't bother to tell her and that I told my kids first, when she never asked for an update.  Today she said this was unforgivable, and that she wants a divorce.  My family members funeral is in two days...\n\nIn my head I guess I could have called her and said  \"hey they died I'm headed back to their house I will keep you posted\" but I was just so devasted that her first thought was the ceiling, and with the obvious grief of my family member's passing I just didn't want to, AITAH?\n\n",

          "selftext": "Hello all, it's been a little bit since my original post. I was going to update on Saturday after the family dinner, which was postponed until a few days ago. No idea why. I was not expecting my post to gain much attention, but reading the comments reaffirmed my belief that I have done nothing wrong. (This is probably going to be a really long post, so strap in!) \n\nI’d like to clarify a few things before getting into the update. First off my mother and Rob are not siblings, my father is his older brother. My father was the first born, then it was uncle Richard, uncle Jim and Rob as the youngest. I saw a lot of comments saying that I was an adult and I didn't have to go, which under normal circumstances, you are correct. But my mother is not normal, I personally believe she is a narcissist but I am not a professional that can diagnose her as such by any means. My mother has always blackmailed me/threatened me to get me to do whatever she's wanted my entire life, this time she threatened me with kicking me out of the house if I hadn't gone to the party. The average rent for an apartment where I live is $1,300-$2,000 a month and I only work part time. I cannot afford to live on my own at the moment. Some people are comfortable finding a roommate online and going from there, but I'm not personally okay with that. Those of you who said my mom was jealous of the relationship aunt Kathy and I have, you were on the money. She's always hated that I spent a lot more time with aunt Kathy and she always corrected aunt Kathy when she heard her refer to me as her daughter-niece,  always saying, “just a niece, actually. Remember that.” \n\nNow, onto the update. As I'd mentioned in the mini update to my original post, my father was originally inviting Rob and Becky for dinner, to sort out what happened and hopefully amend the issue so that we can move past this, but after he learned of the assault that took place between Becky and I, and seeing that bruise set him off. He devised a new plan. Rob and Becky arrived and we all sat down, my father was direct and asked Becky and Rob for their side of the story. Becky had told dad I was being rude by not only not greeting her when we came in, but that I'd ignored her the entire night. Which was true, I couldn't deny that, she then stated that I had told her she didn't deserve to be a mother and that I had shoved her FIRST!! I was absolutely flabbergasted and shook my head, before I could defend myself, Rob stepped in. He turned to Becky and asked if she was seriously going to lie so blatantly and make me look bad. She doubled down and told him that he was clearly not remembering the night's events correctly, and that those drinks he had “clouded” his mind and judgment. My dad turned to my mom and asked her what happened, to which she said it had nothing to do with her, which I directly challenged. I asked how it had nothing to do with her when she was the one who forced me to go to that party by threatening to kick me out of the house, and reminded her that if she hadn't forced me to go or tried to force me to congratulate Becky that this never would have happened. She got tight lipped and told me I was out of line. Rob cut in and told my father what actually transpired that night, and said that he begged Becky to apologize to me for being rude but she had refused. My father accepted this and excused himself from the table, he went upstairs briefly and came back with two files and set it in front of himself and glared at Becky. He opened the first one with the pictures I had sent him of my bruises. Rob looked horrified to see those pictures, and asked what was in the second file dad had kept closed. He ignored Rob, his eyes never leaving Becky. He told Becky that she had one chance to come clean about what happened that night and apologize to me before he took me to the police station to file a police report for assault and give Rob the second file he had in front of him. Becky told him that if a police report was filed, that she'd just say that I assaulted her first by shoving her and it would be a “he said, she said” case. She said she did nothing wrong and clearly I had the problem here. I myself was curious what was in the second file, but I said nothing. My father shook his head and told her that was the wrong response, and handed the second file to Rob. He opened it and it contained several photos of Becky…with another man! Becky went pale, then became angry and said that they were clearly doctored photos and that she was being faithful to her husband, but neither dad nor Rob believed her. Rob asked Becky if this baby was even his, of course she said it was and that my father was just creating drama to defend his, and I quote, “disrespectful, petty brat of a child.” Rob stood up and said that he was done with Becky and that he would be divorcing her, and that he wanted a DNA test on the baby. Becky started crying and said she'd get an abortion if he left, to which Rob pulled out his wallet and threw a few hundred bills at her and told her to go ahead. He left and Becky ran after him. I asked dad how he had those pictures. He told me a buddy of his is a P.I (private investigator) and he called in a favor. So now there's a chance the baby Becky has isn't even Robs… a part of me feels bad for him, but another part feels like he's getting a taste of his medicine.\n\nI saw aunt Kathy today! I filled her in on the drama and she was not too happy. She was very upset with Becky and how Rob handled it, she initially scolded me for being rude but understood where I was coming from. Another surprise is that apparently Becky is one of my mothers relatives! Mom has never spoke of her family or her life before dad, so I had no idea she had any family members, that explains why she has this undying loyalty to Becky. Aunt Kathy thought I knew and thought that was why I’ve disliked her all these years, but this was news to me. Aunt Kathy doesn’t know much about my moms life, but she knows she doesn’t communicate with her family because of “major abuse.” I won’t lie, that made me roll my eyes, since my mom clearly isn’t much different herself, but oh well. On a more positive note, aunt Kathy offered to let me move in with her! I, of course, accepted her offer and I’m in the process of packing my things up as I’m posting this. My mom tried to prevent it but my father stepped in and reminded her that I have a say, mom was not happy and stormed out of the house as a result. I’ve decided to go no contact with her for now, if she changes her attitude I may go low contact but that is to be determined. \n\nDad and I have decided to go to the police station and file the assault, so far there is not much I can say on that front, but Becky is in deep. Rob has since reached out to me and apologized and asked if we can go get coffee, I initially didn’t want to, but I decided to hear him out. If I find out if this baby isn’t his, I’ll add an edit. But so far that’s all I have going on, this has been more than enough drama for me lol. OP signing off, take care all and be safe out there!",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all, it&amp;#39;s been a little bit since my original post. I was going to update on Saturday after the family dinner, which was postponed until a few days ago. No idea why. I was not expecting my post to gain much attention, but reading the comments reaffirmed my belief that I have done nothing wrong. (This is probably going to be a really long post, so strap in!) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d like to clarify a few things before getting into the update. First off my mother and Rob are not siblings, my father is his older brother. My father was the first born, then it was uncle Richard, uncle Jim and Rob as the youngest. I saw a lot of comments saying that I was an adult and I didn&amp;#39;t have to go, which under normal circumstances, you are correct. But my mother is not normal, I personally believe she is a narcissist but I am not a professional that can diagnose her as such by any means. My mother has always blackmailed me/threatened me to get me to do whatever she&amp;#39;s wanted my entire life, this time she threatened me with kicking me out of the house if I hadn&amp;#39;t gone to the party. The average rent for an apartment where I live is $1,300-$2,000 a month and I only work part time. I cannot afford to live on my own at the moment. Some people are comfortable finding a roommate online and going from there, but I&amp;#39;m not personally okay with that. Those of you who said my mom was jealous of the relationship aunt Kathy and I have, you were on the money. She&amp;#39;s always hated that I spent a lot more time with aunt Kathy and she always corrected aunt Kathy when she heard her refer to me as her daughter-niece,  always saying, “just a niece, actually. Remember that.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, onto the update. As I&amp;#39;d mentioned in the mini update to my original post, my father was originally inviting Rob and Becky for dinner, to sort out what happened and hopefully amend the issue so that we can move past this, but after he learned of the assault that took place between Becky and I, and seeing that bruise set him off. He devised a new plan. Rob and Becky arrived and we all sat down, my father was direct and asked Becky and Rob for their side of the story. Becky had told dad I was being rude by not only not greeting her when we came in, but that I&amp;#39;d ignored her the entire night. Which was true, I couldn&amp;#39;t deny that, she then stated that I had told her she didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be a mother and that I had shoved her FIRST!! I was absolutely flabbergasted and shook my head, before I could defend myself, Rob stepped in. He turned to Becky and asked if she was seriously going to lie so blatantly and make me look bad. She doubled down and told him that he was clearly not remembering the night&amp;#39;s events correctly, and that those drinks he had “clouded” his mind and judgment. My dad turned to my mom and asked her what happened, to which she said it had nothing to do with her, which I directly challenged. I asked how it had nothing to do with her when she was the one who forced me to go to that party by threatening to kick me out of the house, and reminded her that if she hadn&amp;#39;t forced me to go or tried to force me to congratulate Becky that this never would have happened. She got tight lipped and told me I was out of line. Rob cut in and told my father what actually transpired that night, and said that he begged Becky to apologize to me for being rude but she had refused. My father accepted this and excused himself from the table, he went upstairs briefly and came back with two files and set it in front of himself and glared at Becky. He opened the first one with the pictures I had sent him of my bruises. Rob looked horrified to see those pictures, and asked what was in the second file dad had kept closed. He ignored Rob, his eyes never leaving Becky. He told Becky that she had one chance to come clean about what happened that night and apologize to me before he took me to the police station to file a police report for assault and give Rob the second file he had in front of him. Becky told him that if a police report was filed, that she&amp;#39;d just say that I assaulted her first by shoving her and it would be a “he said, she said” case. She said she did nothing wrong and clearly I had the problem here. I myself was curious what was in the second file, but I said nothing. My father shook his head and told her that was the wrong response, and handed the second file to Rob. He opened it and it contained several photos of Becky…with another man! Becky went pale, then became angry and said that they were clearly doctored photos and that she was being faithful to her husband, but neither dad nor Rob believed her. Rob asked Becky if this baby was even his, of course she said it was and that my father was just creating drama to defend his, and I quote, “disrespectful, petty brat of a child.” Rob stood up and said that he was done with Becky and that he would be divorcing her, and that he wanted a DNA test on the baby. Becky started crying and said she&amp;#39;d get an abortion if he left, to which Rob pulled out his wallet and threw a few hundred bills at her and told her to go ahead. He left and Becky ran after him. I asked dad how he had those pictures. He told me a buddy of his is a P.I (private investigator) and he called in a favor. So now there&amp;#39;s a chance the baby Becky has isn&amp;#39;t even Robs… a part of me feels bad for him, but another part feels like he&amp;#39;s getting a taste of his medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw aunt Kathy today! I filled her in on the drama and she was not too happy. She was very upset with Becky and how Rob handled it, she initially scolded me for being rude but understood where I was coming from. Another surprise is that apparently Becky is one of my mothers relatives! Mom has never spoke of her family or her life before dad, so I had no idea she had any family members, that explains why she has this undying loyalty to Becky. Aunt Kathy thought I knew and thought that was why I’ve disliked her all these years, but this was news to me. Aunt Kathy doesn’t know much about my moms life, but she knows she doesn’t communicate with her family because of “major abuse.” I won’t lie, that made me roll my eyes, since my mom clearly isn’t much different herself, but oh well. On a more positive note, aunt Kathy offered to let me move in with her! I, of course, accepted her offer and I’m in the process of packing my things up as I’m posting this. My mom tried to prevent it but my father stepped in and reminded her that I have a say, mom was not happy and stormed out of the house as a result. I’ve decided to go no contact with her for now, if she changes her attitude I may go low contact but that is to be determined. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dad and I have decided to go to the police station and file the assault, so far there is not much I can say on that front, but Becky is in deep. Rob has since reached out to me and apologized and asked if we can go get coffee, I initially didn’t want to, but I decided to hear him out. If I find out if this baby isn’t his, I’ll add an edit. But so far that’s all I have going on, this has been more than enough drama for me lol. OP signing off, take care all and be safe out there!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "So for context 5 months ago my older sister 33F and her husband 36M passed away in a car accident, and I stepped up to raise her two kids 1M and 5F so my abusive parents couldn't dnt get ahold of them. This surprisingly upset my wife of nearly 10 years as she was comforting and understanding when the news first came out. After that day after day shes cruel to my 5 year old niece and refuses to acknowledge her. Since last year I've been in a legal battle to get my sisters children in a safe home, our parents were extremely abusive during our whole lives and we agreed to never let any of our children be near/be in their custody. Well my wife wasn't fond of the idea I let her know it was non negotiable. For the past five years me and my wife have been trying for a baby, as   we have always wanted to be parents, we found out pretty quick that she was infertile and it was going to be extremely difficult to get pregnant.  \n\nThis caused my wife a lot of stress and depression, she started to act like a whole new person and was obsessed with sex with only the intent of conceiving. After a year of trying she finally found out she was pregnant and this was a miracle for our marriage, she became so much more loving, caring and talked about being able to feel the baby and it just overall \"fixed\" her. My sister's wedding was coming up around that time and my wife was very insistent of not going because of \"pregnancy anxiety\" as she called it but I didn't wanna miss my sister's wedding. At the wedding she caused a big scene because my sister didn't clearly specify if the mocktails were non alcoholic  and complained that the baby could have \"unnatural birth defects\" the wedding ended up being cut short due to my parents causing a larger scene. The pregnancy obsession continued until I found my wife bloody on the bathroom floor and drove her to the ER. They confirmed she miscarried and she told them she has been seeing blood for a few weeks. We got in a bit of an argument but I took care of her and let her know we didn't need a child to be a complete family, she took this the wrong way and cursed me out and stayed at her brothers house. Her emotions and mood drastically deteriorated after this and she started to become homicidal and suicidal. \n\nShe moved back in and was just worse, everyday she would threaten me, insult me, blame the miscarriage on me, and it only got worse once my sister announced she was pregnant and expecting a baby girl. This sent my wife in a slew of emotions and she genuinely terrified me. My sister had her baby and she ended up having autism. My wife resented my niece and never wanted to be near her, and insulted my families bad genes, by the time my niece was a toddler she was an advanced baby and knew how to read and write. My wife still hated her and would bad mouth her. Everyday I would have to walk around egg shells to keep her happy because her and my family called me a a**hole for \"kicking out a pregnant woman\" I didn't dare to blame or insult her anymore after that. \n\nI ended up moving away with my wife for a work opportunity and so she could be near her family because of her declining mental health. In 2023 my sister was expecting her second and my wife was surprisingly excited and happy for the baby to be born into \"her\" family, after the baby was born she was weirdly attached to it and would drive 2 hrs to see him. My sister expressed her discomfort with my wife visiting so often but brushed it off to my wife just grieving. Fast forward to late 2023, I was notified by my local police department that my sister had passed away. I took this hard and my wife fortunately was there to get me through it but I am still grieving as my sister was all the family I had. I applied custody for my nephew and niece as my sister would have wanted, but my wife was extremely opposed to having my niece home but she wanted to \"adopt\" my nephew I told her no the baby was gonna be adopted since he already has a mother and that my niece was staying. We've had this conversation more than once. The other day my niece has come to me and told me my wife had been treating her wrongly and doesn't feed her dinner when I'm at work. \n\nAnd then told me the history of abuse my wife was inflicting on her. I agree me and my wife have had a rocky road, but she knows and understands my history of abuse and stood against it. I was furious once I found this out, I confronting her with anger and she told me my niece was a liar and didn't know what she was talking about, my niece has very good memory and is able to remember vividly and has strong feelings towards lying. I told my wife to shut the f*ck up and get out of my house before I made her. She refused and stayed inside, I took my niece and nephew and went to a hotel to cool down. I now realize it may have been a bit harsh because I was prepared to physically assault her, but I couldn't let this one go this time. And she has been calling and texting me saying I need to bring my nephew back to her because he needs her (as his mother) and I'm ignoring her. I've been raising two kids alone at the moment drained and depressed and on the verge of getting fired, but no way in hell am I going to let these poor kids get abused just as I did. I feel so alone and unsure to file for divorce. I just want these kids to live as best of lives as they can. Any advice is highly appreciated.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for context 5 months ago my older sister 33F and her husband 36M passed away in a car accident, and I stepped up to raise her two kids 1M and 5F so my abusive parents couldn&amp;#39;t dnt get ahold of them. This surprisingly upset my wife of nearly 10 years as she was comforting and understanding when the news first came out. After that day after day shes cruel to my 5 year old niece and refuses to acknowledge her. Since last year I&amp;#39;ve been in a legal battle to get my sisters children in a safe home, our parents were extremely abusive during our whole lives and we agreed to never let any of our children be near/be in their custody. Well my wife wasn&amp;#39;t fond of the idea I let her know it was non negotiable. For the past five years me and my wife have been trying for a baby, as   we have always wanted to be parents, we found out pretty quick that she was infertile and it was going to be extremely difficult to get pregnant.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This caused my wife a lot of stress and depression, she started to act like a whole new person and was obsessed with sex with only the intent of conceiving. After a year of trying she finally found out she was pregnant and this was a miracle for our marriage, she became so much more loving, caring and talked about being able to feel the baby and it just overall &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; her. My sister&amp;#39;s wedding was coming up around that time and my wife was very insistent of not going because of &amp;quot;pregnancy anxiety&amp;quot; as she called it but I didn&amp;#39;t wanna miss my sister&amp;#39;s wedding. At the wedding she caused a big scene because my sister didn&amp;#39;t clearly specify if the mocktails were non alcoholic  and complained that the baby could have &amp;quot;unnatural birth defects&amp;quot; the wedding ended up being cut short due to my parents causing a larger scene. The pregnancy obsession continued until I found my wife bloody on the bathroom floor and drove her to the ER. They confirmed she miscarried and she told them she has been seeing blood for a few weeks. We got in a bit of an argument but I took care of her and let her know we didn&amp;#39;t need a child to be a complete family, she took this the wrong way and cursed me out and stayed at her brothers house. Her emotions and mood drastically deteriorated after this and she started to become homicidal and suicidal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She moved back in and was just worse, everyday she would threaten me, insult me, blame the miscarriage on me, and it only got worse once my sister announced she was pregnant and expecting a baby girl. This sent my wife in a slew of emotions and she genuinely terrified me. My sister had her baby and she ended up having autism. My wife resented my niece and never wanted to be near her, and insulted my families bad genes, by the time my niece was a toddler she was an advanced baby and knew how to read and write. My wife still hated her and would bad mouth her. Everyday I would have to walk around egg shells to keep her happy because her and my family called me a a**hole for &amp;quot;kicking out a pregnant woman&amp;quot; I didn&amp;#39;t dare to blame or insult her anymore after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up moving away with my wife for a work opportunity and so she could be near her family because of her declining mental health. In 2023 my sister was expecting her second and my wife was surprisingly excited and happy for the baby to be born into &amp;quot;her&amp;quot; family, after the baby was born she was weirdly attached to it and would drive 2 hrs to see him. My sister expressed her discomfort with my wife visiting so often but brushed it off to my wife just grieving. Fast forward to late 2023, I was notified by my local police department that my sister had passed away. I took this hard and my wife fortunately was there to get me through it but I am still grieving as my sister was all the family I had. I applied custody for my nephew and niece as my sister would have wanted, but my wife was extremely opposed to having my niece home but she wanted to &amp;quot;adopt&amp;quot; my nephew I told her no the baby was gonna be adopted since he already has a mother and that my niece was staying. We&amp;#39;ve had this conversation more than once. The other day my niece has come to me and told me my wife had been treating her wrongly and doesn&amp;#39;t feed her dinner when I&amp;#39;m at work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then told me the history of abuse my wife was inflicting on her. I agree me and my wife have had a rocky road, but she knows and understands my history of abuse and stood against it. I was furious once I found this out, I confronting her with anger and she told me my niece was a liar and didn&amp;#39;t know what she was talking about, my niece has very good memory and is able to remember vividly and has strong feelings towards lying. I told my wife to shut the f*ck up and get out of my house before I made her. She refused and stayed inside, I took my niece and nephew and went to a hotel to cool down.

She works from home and I work from office. \n\nI was sent by my team across the state lines for a week and was set to return on Tuesday. Now this weekend was extremely crucial for one of us to be there as the landlord was sending over professionals to get the vents cleaned out. Currently the temperatures are fine and we don’t need AC but soon we will. Also, the next time the professionals will be available through the landlord will be several weeks from now and by that time summer would’ve already rolled in. I had requested my wife to stay put on the weekend I was going away because the landlord was doing it free of charge and if we were to have professionals ourselves we would have to pay a couple hundred dollars. \n\n\nIt’s important for us to get the vents cleaned since when we turned on the AC one day there was a horrible smell (maybe a rat died in the thing) and we quickly closed them and since been opening the windows. \n\nI was out of state assuming the vents were cleaned out. When I returned my wife said that she was invited on a road trip by her girlfriends and she couldn’t say no as she hadn’t seen them in a long time. I was furious for being so irresponsible. I told her fine, the extra cost for getting the cleaners now will be deducted from her “fun” money account (we have 3 bank accounts, our 2 individual accounts for “fun” money and 1 joint account) - she absolutely refused. Saying that I get to go out and have fun and beers while she works from home and deserves an outing and didn’t think of saying no. \n\n**EDIT: WE BOTH HAD AGREED SHE WOULD SUPERVISE THINGS AND SHE NEVER LET ME KNOW SHE WENT OUT WITH HER FRIENDS. I NEVER GAVE HER ORDERS!!**\n\n**But this was an important job to fix and I wanted her to act like my partner for once**\n\nThis caused an argument but no resolution and she kicked me out of our bedroom. This made me more mad than her refusal to pay in full or staying home. I felt emasculated for being kicked out of my own godamn bedroom and that too for 3 nights. \n\nHer birthday was also coming up in a few days and I had managed to score some tickets for a musical theatre performance in our city. They are fairly exclusive and she was looking forward to us going as she’s a big fan of what they were going to be performing that night. I disinvited her and she flew into mad rage. I told her that this is her consequences for **what she did (prioritise a road trip, and kicking me out of our room)** and **didn’t do (stay home for the professionals and agreeing to compensate from her fun money account)**. I instead extended an invite to my other friend who happily accepted and we went. \n\nEven on her birthday, she took the time and effort to dress up and presented herself to me and casually said if we are supposed to leave by now. It’s almost as if she forgot what happened still thinking I wouldn’t go through with what I had said I’d do. I shrugged my shoulders and said she’s delusional for even thinking that. I left the house with her looking paler than ever. It was oddly satisfying.  \n\n\nWhen I came back, she was crying but still looked like she was seething. She screamed at me for ruining a birthday over a few hundred dollars and says she can never forgive me for what I did. I reminded her she kicked me out of our room, how can she expect me to be nice to her? And that I was glad to know she was miserable all day. Did I go too far?",

I have been told I am cute but that my mouth usually turns anyone away from wanting to date me. I was told next that it was friendly banter and not to be too offended by that comment. \n\nWell, my older sister was interested in my perpetual bachelorhood a few weeks ago and offered to try to help me find someone. I appreciated the help so I accepted her offer, and last week she told me about a friend of hers who was looking for someone and she gave me some information and offered to introduce us. \n\nThe woman in question seems like a nice person. She volunteers a lot, she is interested in a lot of the same television shows and hobbies that I am interested in, and my sister has talked her up to be a great individual that I would be happy to date. Then she showed me some pictures of her and answered some questions and the other shoe dropped. \n\nI feel really guilty for saying this, but I find her to be extremely unattractive as a potential partner. She is well more than 200 lbs overweight. Her chin melts directly into her neck. She is also much older than me, turning 30 in three months, and she already has a child. This child also has severe autism (nonverbal) and that is just a whole bag of worms to deal with. I should know. \n\nWell, because I don't know the rules of the social jujitsu everyone plays she immediately saw my disapproval and I made the mistake of telling my sister exactly why I was not happy. She got mad and called me shallow and I somewhat agree with her, but I just feel conflicted. Ultimately, I feel like she was doing a favor to her friend by trying to get her with me rather than doing a favor to me. I know I am not the most desirable person in the world but I still feel somewhat insulted by the idea that my sister thinks the ideal partner for me would be a morbidly obese single mother seven years my senior. I also feel like I might actually be a shallow jackass for feeling like I deserve better. AITAH?",
